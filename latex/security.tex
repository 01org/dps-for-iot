D\+PS has two security mechanisms\+: end-\/to-\/end encryption and link-\/layer encryption.

Publication and acknowledgement messages can be encrypted end-\/to-\/end. Messages are encrypted using \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8152}{\tt C\+O\+SE}.

For privacy and to protect the network hop-\/by-\/hop links D\+PS uses link layer encryption where possible\+: D\+T\+LS for U\+DP, T\+LS for T\+CP, and transport-\/specific encryption for over non-\/\+IP networks. IP multicast packets do not use link-\/layer encryption. Because D\+PS is fundamentally a multi-\/hop mesh protocol payloads are secured end-\/to-\/end.

As noted above publications and acknowledgement messages can be encrypted using C\+O\+SE. The encryption in this case is end-\/to-\/end, the trust relationship is directly between the publishing node and the subscribing node, and intermediate nodes that simply route packets over the D\+PS mesh do not require a trust relationship with either the publishers or subscribers and do not hold decryption keys. The publication or acknowledgement data payload is encrypted, publications also carry the publication topic strings these are included in the encrypted payload. Message fields required for routing messages are integrity checked but obviously cannot be encrypted. The sending port number and T\+TL change on each hop so cannot be included in the end-\/to-\/end integrity check. The C\+O\+SE format includes an optional K\+ID (key-\/identifier) field. Encrypted D\+PS messages always have a K\+ID which allows the different publications to use different encryption keys.

Subscriptions do not carry payload data and the bit vectors carried in the payloads get recomputed at each hop. Unlike publications and acknowledgements, subscriptions do not use C\+O\+SE and rely solely on encryption at the link-\/layer.

Even when data is encrypted there are attack vectors based on traffic analysis. Traffic analysis is harder on a multi-\/hop mesh but because publications contain routing information that cannot be encrypted end-\/to-\/end. Specifically an attacker with access to a compromised node could use a dictionary attack to identify the topic strings in the publications and subscriptions flowing through that node. Where this is a concern the publishing and subscribing end-\/points can agree on a shared private encoding of topic strings, for example H\+M\+AC with a shared seed.

The following sections assume you are already familiar with the \hyperlink{message-types-and-flow_message-encoding}{message encoding }.\hypertarget{security_content-encryption}{}\section{Content Encryption}\label{security_content-encryption}
The {\itshape protected} section of a D\+PS message forms the protected attributes from the application as identified in C\+O\+SE. The {\itshape encrypted} section of a D\+PS message is the plaintext provided to the content encryption algorithm and is replaced by a C\+O\+SE object, either a {\itshape C\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+Encrypt\+\_\+\+Tagged} or {\itshape C\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+Encrypt0\+\_\+\+Tagged} object.

The implemented content encryption algorithms are {\itshape A\+E\+S-\/\+C\+C\+M-\/16-\/128-\/128} and {\itshape A\+E\+S-\/\+C\+C\+M-\/16-\/64-\/128}.\hypertarget{security_content-key-distribution}{}\section{Content Key Distribution}\label{security_content-key-distribution}
The encryption key is determined by the recipient algorithm. D\+PS supports the {\itshape direct}, {\itshape A128\+KW}, {\itshape E\+C\+D\+H-\/\+ES + H\+K\+D\+F-\/256}, and {\itshape E\+C\+D\+H-\/\+ES + A128\+KW} recipient algorithms.

The use of the key wrap variants allows multiple recipients to be included in a message.\hypertarget{security_elliptic-curve-keys}{}\subsection{Elliptic Curve Keys}\label{security_elliptic-curve-keys}
D\+PS supports the {\itshape N\+I\+ST P-\/256 (secp256r1)}, {\itshape N\+I\+ST P-\/384 (secp384r1)}, and {\itshape N\+I\+ST P-\/521 (secp521r1)} curves.

Point compression is not supported. Both the x and y coordinates must be included in EC key representations such as the ephemeral sender key.\hypertarget{security_key-derivation-functions}{}\subsection{Key Derivation Functions}\label{security_key-derivation-functions}
H\+K\+DF requires context information to be provided. This is represented in C\+O\+SE as the {\itshape C\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+K\+D\+F\+\_\+\+Context}.

The values of the {\itshape identity}, {\itshape nonce}, and {\itshape other} fields of the {\itshape Party\+U\+Info} and {\itshape Party\+V\+Info} structures in the {\itshape C\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+K\+D\+F\+\_\+\+Context} are {\itshape nil}.

{\itshape Supp\+Priv\+Info} is not included in the {\itshape C\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+K\+D\+F\+\_\+\+Context}.\hypertarget{security_counter-signatures}{}\section{Counter Signatures}\label{security_counter-signatures}
After encryption, the encrypted content is signed by the sender and the signature is included as a C\+O\+SE counter signature. This allows intermediate D\+PS nodes to authenticate the sender of a message without decrypting the contents of the message.

D\+PS supports the {\itshape E\+S256}, {\itshape E\+S384}, and {\itshape E\+S512} signature algorithms.\hypertarget{security_examples}{}\section{Examples}\label{security_examples}
An example encrypted publication message, using {\itshape A\+E\+S-\/\+C\+C\+M-\/16-\/128-\/128} for the content, {\itshape E\+C\+D\+H-\/\+E\+S+\+A128\+KW} for the key distribution, and {\itshape E\+S256} for signing, will look like\+:
