D\+PS has built-\/in support for data series.

In addition to topic strings, every publication has a U\+U\+ID and serial number. Publications with same U\+U\+ID (and topic strings) form a series, the serial number is incremented each time the publication is sent to the network. The U\+U\+ID and serial number are available to the receiving subscribers.
