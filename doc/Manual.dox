/**
 * @page tutorials Tutorials
 *
 * The tutorials provide an introduction into the DPS APIs.  It's
 * recommended they be read in the order below and assume some
 * familiarity with pub/sub terminology.
 *
 * For compactness, the tutorials use the @c a/b/c/d topic string,
 * where @c a, @c b, @c c, and @c d are the levels and @c / is the
 * level separator, and strings for payload data.  A real application
 * would likely use more meaningful topic strings and structured
 * payloads.
